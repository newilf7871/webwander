# webwander is not like those crappy adware unpopular browsers that people don't download. webwander is open-source and supports google chrome extensions and firefox extensions all without stealing data. WAIT! before you click off this, just because it supports google chrome extensions does not mean that it steals data like google chrome does. now back toÂ flexing what you're missing out on. webwander also lets you get google chrome themes and firefox themes too. dont worry, its also based off chromium so it has the same good stuff about google chrome and microsoft edge or basically any other browser. it also lets you sign in to google which is optional with the setup wizard which if you DO login it will automatically sign you into google apps like youtube or gmail. you can also save themes, bookmarks, and extensions from your old browser so that you can have the best experience out of webwander.
